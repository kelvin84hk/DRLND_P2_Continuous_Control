# Introduction

The goal of this project is to train an agent deep reinforcement learning algorithms so that it can control the robot arm to touch the ball which is moving around it as long as it can.

# Implemention

Two algorithms, Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients (DDPG) and Distributed Distributional Deterministic Policy Gradients (D4PG) have been implemented.
